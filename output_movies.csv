As a young man he is among his friends, in conviviality. He has taken a Bengali wife, Aparna, and everything is wonderful in his life, However the year is 1946, and the imminent independence of India from British suzerainty is complicated by religious antagonism between the Hindu majority and the large Muslim minority, who demand their own independent state. Saketh and Aparna visit Calcutta; rioting is reported, but Saketh goes out to get some food, and he soon encounters a Hindu woman being chased by Muslim rioters. He rescues her, but the rioters later come to his house, and brutally rape and then kill his wife. Saketh is devastated and takes to the streets, determined personally to kill as many Muslims as he can find. He meets up with Sriram Abhiyankar, who is leading a group of Hindu extremists, and Saketh becomes temporarily taken with the cause himself. At the same time, he is persuaded to take a new wife, Mythili, and life begins to stabilize for Saketh after all. However he then falls in with an eminent Maharajah who is leading an underground group with the intention of assassination. Travelling with the Maharajah, Saketh meets one of his old friends from younger days, who has fallen on hard times. Reminiscing, and getting his old friend back on his feet deflect the process of recruiting Saketh, but only temporarily, and soon he is manipulated into committing himself to renouncing his family and his new wife, in the interests of the cause which now is disclosed as the assassination of Gandhi. Although a fellow Hindu, Gandhi was felt by some to be too conciliatory to Muslims and in the logic of extremists, Gandhi became the prime target. Soon Saketh is informed that Gandhi will be in Delhi for some weeks, and that Saketh is to take the opportunity to do ""his duty"". However, hiding from a snap search by the police, he has to hide his pistol on a delivery lorry, and it is driven away to a factory owned by Muslims. Going there hoping to retrieve the gun, he becomes engulfed in a shoot-out between some Hindu attackers and the Muslims, and finds that his loyalties are not so clear cut as he had imagined. Finally he escapes after the death of another of his old friends in the crossfire.

27,tt0124563,First Time at Cherry High,1984,Tanya Lawson,Renee Summers,Valerie LaVeaux,United States,Erica Havens,Adult,,,"Unadulterated schoolgirl fun 'n' fluff in one of the more palatable '80s approximations of acknowledged carnal classic LITTLE GIRLS BLUE. Striking similarities ? which might, of course, amount to little more than plagiarism ? lead one to believe that director ""Eve Milan"" might be another alias for filmmaker Joanna Williams, herself rumored to be former sexploitation siren Ann Myers, even though the franchise's semi-official third installment (the Hans Christian helmed LOOSE TIMES AT RIDLEY HIGH) suggests considerable pro-active involvement at least from its legendary producer William Dancer. Either way, the Milan credit has only appeared on two other movies, presumably shot simultaneously since they all star elusive Tanya Lawson along with several additional cross-over cast members, being FLASHPANTS and THE T&amp;A TEAM.Ms. Pepper's private finishing school for girls holds the reputation for marrying off its alluring alumni to the world's rich and powerful. The academic year drawing to a close, a proposal has yet to materialize however and the stern head mistress (New York actress Chelsea Blake, the pushy stage mom from Ron Sullivan's GREAT SEXPECTATIONS) promises passing grades in exchange for at least one wealthy wedding. Frizzy-haired Valerie LaVeaux (who played Juliet Anderson's teenage daughter and Shanna McCullough's sister in Stu Segall's INSATIABLE II) has the girl/girl wake up call with one shot Cathy Stevens. This dynamic duo subsequently takes on handyman Jerry Butler.Most of the girls lacking both skill and experience necessary to ensnare a potential husband, it's up to ringleader Lawson (Ron Jeremy's erstwhile girlfriend who found religion and quit the business) to instruct them in the pleasures of the flesh, resulting in a spectacular four femme pile-up on nerdy security guard David Scott in the school restroom, memorably scored with a funky instrumental rendition of Santa Claus is Coming to Town ! The future (and now sadly former) Mrs. Eric Edwards, pleasingly pudgy Rene Summers, makes a credible wide-eyed innocent hopelessly in love with computer geek Jesse Eastern. They finally consummate their mutual lust in the cloak room on prom night in an explosive release of pent-up passion. Even prim 'n' proper Ms. Pepper lets it all hang out with dashing Senator Weatherman, patron of the party and portrayed with pomposity worthy of PT by underrated Michael Gaunt. The bleached blond starlet on the pool table with Jeremy is fly by night Silver Starr, also in Sullivan's SEX SPA USA. Carol Cross, a surprisingly decent actress best known for her participation in Candida Royalle's early Femme releases, and future video vixen Natasha Skyler appear in non-sex bit parts.The much talked about group encounter with masked Mystery Lane (presumably a real life swinger) orally servicing a bunch of guys wearing the masks of US Presidents feels tagged on. Legend has it that none of the men were professional porn performers but eager volunteers chomping at the bit. Still, Jeremy's definitely in this scene and Alan Adrian just might be. The set-up sounds like a lot more fun than it actually plays out on screen. The film's opening tease, with Tanya spied upon through binoculars by across the street neighbor George Payne, is delivered upon in spades with their scorching subway number at the end.",N/A,X,6.3/10,,,N/A,82 min,Erica Havens

Fresh off of a successful production of Death of a Salesman, he has traded in the suburban blue-hairs and regional theater of Schenectady for the cultured audiences and bright footlights of Broadway. Armed with a MacArthur grant and determined to create a piece of brutal realism and honesty, something into which he can put his whole self, he gathers an ensemble cast into a warehouse in Manhattan's theater district. He directs them in a celebration of the mundane, instructing each to live out their constructed lives in a small mock-up of the city outside. As the city inside the warehouse grows, Caden's own life veers wildly off the tracks. The shadow of his ex-wife Adele, a celebrated painter who left him years ago for Germany's art scene, sneers at him from every corner. Somewhere in Berlin, his daughter Olive is growing up under the questionable guidance of Adele's friend, Maria. He's helplessly driving his marriage to actress Claire into the ground. Sammy Barnathan, the actor Caden has hired to play himself within the play, is a bit too perfect for the part, and is making it difficult for Caden to revive his relationship with the alluringly candid Hazel. Meanwhile, his therapist, Madeline Gravis, is better at plugging her best-seller than she is at counselling him. His second daughter, Ariel, is disabled. And a mysterious condition is systematically shutting down each of his autonomic functions, one by one. As the years rapidly pass, Caden buries himself deeper into his masterpiece. Populating the cast and crew with doppelgangers, he steadily blurs the line between the world of the play and that of his own deteriorating reality. As he pushes the limits of his relationships, both personally and professionally, a change in creative direction arrives in Millicent Weems, a celebrated theater actress who may offer Caden the break he needs.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MjIyOTI3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODM5NTY5MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg,R,7.5/10,69%,67/100,05 Feb 2009,124 min,Charlie Kaufman
